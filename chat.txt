breaking news:

*study away application deadline extension:* i am pleased to announce that the study away  application deadline has been extended! 

the global education office has agreed to extend the current deadline to december 19th. there is some administrative processing that needs to happen before winter break so a longer extension is unfortunately not possible — this is the longest they could accommodate. 

the new deadline is: *december 19th, 7 am.*

the office of global education will be releasing an official announcement via the student portal. i hope this alleviates some stress. please do reach out to globaled if you need any help or questions answered regarding your application!

[4/14/24, 1:22:01 AM] ‪+212 664‑414242‬: Hey everyone, I just have a few questions if anyone has any ideas: 
Did anyone ever have a US tourist visa and had to go to the US in the Summer using that visa but have a study away in the fall? 

Anyone know if I can study away using the US tourist visa? 

Or if I can keep both the Tourist and Student visa and use both depending on the need? 

Thank you so much ❤️
[4/14/24, 1:29:24 AM] Sehri Nyuad: You can't study on the US tourist visa
[4/14/24, 1:32:41 AM] ‪+212 664‑414242‬: Any idea if I can keep both and use them depending on my reason to enter the US?
[4/14/24, 1:32:43 AM] ‪+1 (917) 582‑3750‬: You can keep both 
But for the study away semester you will have to exit the US and re-enter using the F1 visa + I20 
You can just take a bus to Toronto to cross the border and come right back or get a cheap flight out of the US and re-enter
[4/14/24, 1:34:25 AM] ‪+212 664‑414242‬: Amazing, thank you so much
[4/14/24, 1:34:41 AM] ‪+212 664‑414242‬: Do u know someone who did this?
[4/14/24, 1:35:40 AM] ‪+1 (917) 582‑3750‬: I didn’t do the exact but I have both US tourist and study visas on my passport. And when I came here for study away I used the study visa
[4/14/24, 1:36:44 AM] ‪+212 664‑414242‬: And your tourists visa is still valid right?
[4/14/24, 1:37:45 AM] ‪+1 (917) 582‑3750‬: Yep, nothing happens to one visa when you use the other. You can use it depending on your purpose of travel 
The only rule is you can’t enter on a tourist visa to study and vice versa
[4/14/24, 1:40:33 AM] ‪+212 664‑414242‬: Perfect, thank you so much

[4/15/24, 8:19:01 PM] ‪+381 64 8392450‬: Hello everyone!
We are currently in the process of conducting research for a class project regarding sleep habits among the student population of NYUAD. 
The aim of this survey is to gather insights on sleep quantity and quality students are getting, and to identify any common habits students might have when it comes to sleep.
We are hoping to use the data to create and propose behavioral economic nudges which would help decrease the bad habits students might have around sleep and improve their overall well-being. Currently the Health Center has no data on this, so we hope this might be also implemented in real life. 
Your answers will be fully anonymous and any data you report will be kept strictly confidential.
The survey takes literally 2 minutes to fill out (everything is multiple choice-- you don't have to write if you don't want to)
help us out plspls xx

If you didn’t know already, I’m applying to be Senior Year rep! Moving into senior year is crazy to believe and as a class, I believe there are a few key challenges we face, where we need change:

*1. Uncertainty of the future* 📚🎓📈🤑
Navigating post-grad opportunities is a significant obstacle, my biggest focus as Senior Year rep is to organize career oriented sessions and events

*2. Maxing out Senior Year*🪩🎈⭐️🏝️
Another key priority of mine is to regularly organize memorable class-wide events

*3. Administrative aspects* ✏️🏫🚴‍♀️🏠
Within university processes, we get lost in inefficient systems that often create annoyances we can easily avoid.

Since our first semester here, I’ve loved getting to know everyone better. Serving across various E-boards and working extensively with departments including the CDC and Student Life, *a vote for me would be a vote for genuine action.*

College is meant to be the best and most transformative four years of life. With the short period we have left here, it’s about time we get things done and elect someone that will follow through with what they promise. I’m excited to create a senior year experience we won’t forget!

To learn more about my plans, feel free to check out my *ROR post* and if it resonates, consider voting! Looking forward to seeing you at the Candidates Forum on April 24th :)
